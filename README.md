**Project Overview**
The aim of this project was to use data analytics techniques to evaluate and recommend the optimal playing 11 for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2022. By applying web scraping, data transformation, and visual analytics, this project provided valuable insights for team selection. The data was sourced from the ESPN Cricinfo website and analyzed using Python and Power BI to generate actionable recommendations for team strategy.

**Key Steps**
1. Web Scraping Data from ESPN Cricinfo
🚀 Leveraged Bright Data (formerly Luminati) to scrape detailed match statistics, player performances, and tournament data from the ESPN Cricinfo website.
📊 Data collected included:
Player batting, bowling, and fielding statistics
Match results and tournament progress
💾 Data storage: The raw scraped data was saved in JSON format for subsequent analysis.
2. Data Transformation and Preprocessing
🧹 Used Python & Pandas to process and convert the raw JSON data into structured CSV files for easy integration with Power BI.
🔄 Data cleaning and formatting to ensure compatibility with Power BI’s data model, making it easy to link related datasets and tables.
3. Power BI Dashboard Creation
🎨 Power Query Editor was used to perform additional data cleaning and transformation in Power BI.
📈 Created interactive Power BI dashboards with multiple visualizations:
Player performance analysis (batting, bowling, and fielding)
Key performance metrics like batting strike rates, bowling economy, and average player contributions
Insights on team composition (e.g., power hitters, reliable bowlers)
🖱️ Dashboards allowed users to filter data by:
Players
