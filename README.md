Project Overview:
The aim of this project was to use data analytics techniques to evaluate and recommend the optimal playing 11 for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2022. By applying web scraping, data transformation, and visual analytics, this project provided valuable insights for team selection. The data was sourced from the ESPN Cricinfo website and analyzed using Python and Power BI to generate actionable recommendations for team strategy.

Key Steps:
Web Scraping Data from ESPN Cricinfo:
Leveraged Bright Data (formerly Luminati) to scrape detailed match statistics, player performances, and tournament data from the ESPN Cricinfo website.
Data collected included player batting, bowling, and fielding statistics, match results, and tournament progress.
The raw scraped data was saved in JSON format for subsequent analysis.
Data Transformation and Preprocessing:
Using Python and the Pandas library, the raw JSON data was processed and converted into structured CSV files for easy integration with Power BI.
Data was cleaned, formatted, and transformed to ensure compatibility with Power BI’s data model, making it easy to link related datasets and tables.
Power BI Dashboard Creation:
In Power BI, utilized Power Query Editor to perform additional data cleaning and transformation, ensuring the data was ready for analysis.
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple visualizations such as:
Player performance analysis (batting, bowling, and fielding).
Key performance metrics like batting strike rates, bowling economy, and average player contributions.
Insights on team composition, such as power hitters and reliable bowlers.
Dashboards allowed users to filter data by players, teams, and match types, making it highly interactive and insightful.
Determining the Best Playing 11:
Using insights from the Power BI dashboard, performed data-driven analysis to identify the optimal playing 11 players based on performance metrics.
The selection process was based on a combination of factors including player form, match conditions, and team requirements, optimizing the team’s chances of success in the tournament.

Technologies Used:
